# kapps
kapps is an app framework for Kindles with E Ink displays, such as the Kindle Touch, among many others. These devices run Linux and, with a jailbreak can be made to run any software. This framework is based on a combination of Python and web technologies, allowing the implementation of applications, or apps, with or without graphical user interface (GUI). By providing a framework for communication between apps and the GUI, as well as defining a basic package format, apps can be easily loaded, and communicate with each other, as well as the GUI.
